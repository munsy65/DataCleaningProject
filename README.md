# DataCleaningProject
This repository host the R code and docmentation for a data cleaning project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

## Files

The script assumes the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses that combines the text files and then creates a clean dataset that displays all std and mean varibles. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the script is called `Average_data.txt` with is in the form of averages for all subjects by activity.
